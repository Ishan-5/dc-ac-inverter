# 12V DC to 220V AC Inverter
![Inverter Setup](inverter.jpg)

Designed and implemented a DC–AC inverter converting 12V battery input to 220V AC for low-power AC loads.

## Objective

To design a basic inverter circuit capable of converting DC power from a battery source into usable AC output.

## Components Used

- 12V Battery
- Transformer
- Switching Transistors / MOSFETs
- Oscillator Circuit
- Heat Sink
- Connecting Wires

## Working Principle

The inverter converts 12V DC into alternating current using a switching mechanism. The oscillator generates alternating signals that drive the switching components, which in turn energize the transformer to produce stepped-up AC voltage.

## Testing

- Verified AC output using multimeter
- Tested under low-power load conditions
- Observed output stability and performance

## Future Improvements

- Add pure sine wave generation
- Implement overcurrent protection
- Improve efficiency using MOSFET drivers
